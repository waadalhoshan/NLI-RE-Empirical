Definitions for Root Classes:

  Functional: Functional requirements define the essential functions a system must perform, the services it must offer, and the behaviours it must exhibit under specified conditions. They focus on what the system should do—describing actions, operations, or transformations the system executes—without addressing implementation constraints. They typically specify the inputs (stimuli) to the system, the outputs (responses) from the system, and the behavioural relationships between them.

  Non-functional: Non-functional requirements identify any property, characteristic, attribute, quality, constraint, or performance aspect of a system. These requirements are not specifically concerned with the functionality of a system. They place restrictions on the product being developed and the development process and specify criteria that can be used to judge the operation of a system, rather than specific behaviours. Non-functional requirements include Performance, which is concerned with responsiveness and efficient processing; Scalability, which is concerned with the ability of the system to handle growth in users or data; Portability, which is concerned with operation across different platforms and environments; Compatibility, which is concerned with smooth interaction with other systems; Reliability, which is concerned with guaranteeing consistent and failure-free operation; Maintainability, which refers to the ease of updating and modifying the system; Availability, which measures the system's uptime and accessibility; Security, which is concerned with protection measures against unauthorized access and threats; Usability, which ensures the system is intuitive and user-friendly; Fault Tolerance, which refers to the system’s ability to continue operating correctly even when faults occur; Legal, which involves compliance with laws, regulations, and licensing; Look & Feel, which relates to the visual appearance and user interface consistency; and Operational, which covers system operations.
