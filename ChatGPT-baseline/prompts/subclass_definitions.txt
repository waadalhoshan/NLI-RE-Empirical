Definitions for Subclass (Only for Non-functional):

  Security – Security requirements define the protections needed for both the system’s facility (physical security) and its operations (cybersecurity), such as access control, data encryption, and threat mitigation. Examples include login authentication, audit logs, and restricted communication between system components—especially critical in safety-critical systems to prevent unauthorized access or data breaches.

  Performance – Performance requirements specify the system's critical operational capabilities, including speed (e.g., response times, movement rates), endurance (e.g., lifespan, session duration), and efficiency under defined conditions. They also define performance expectations for different operational modes and phases, ensuring the system meets user needs in real-world use.

  Operational – Operational requirements define the specific conditions, constraints, and scenarios under which a system must function effectively. They describe the operational environment, expected usage patterns, and interactions with users, other systems, and external factors.

  Scalability – Scalability requirements define the capability of a system to expand and adapt to the changing size and needs of the client and the environment in which the system is deployed. They ensure the system can handle increased workloads (e.g., more users, higher data volumes) without sacrificing performance, often through modular design or elastic resource allocation.

  Usability – Usability requirements define how easily, effectively, efficiently, and satisfactorily users can achieve their goals with the system. They include measurable criteria for: ease of use (intuitive navigation, minimal training required, accessibility compliance); effectiveness (task completion accuracy, error rates); efficiency (time/resources required, steps to completion); user satisfaction (feedback scores, comfort, perceived usability).

  Maintainability – Maintainability requirements define measurable targets for keeping the system operational, including downtime limits (e.g., mean time to repair, MTTR), resource efficiency (e.g., staff hours per repair), and logistical factors like component accessibility. They cover metrics such as repair rates, maintenance frequency, cost-per-operation, and the complexity of tasks (e.g., tools or skills needed). These requirements ensure the system can be sustained efficiently in its planned support environment.

  Availability – Availability requirements define the degree to which a system, service, or component must be operational and accessible during specified periods and under defined conditions. These requirements establish measurable expectations for uptime (e.g., 99.9% availability), scheduled operational windows (e.g., 24/7 or business hours), and permissible downtime (e.g., no more than 10 minutes per year). They may also specify recovery timelines after outages, dependency-based availability (e.g., subject to network accessibility), and varying thresholds for critical operational periods. Availability requirements ensure consistent service delivery, align with user expectations, and support continuity of operations—especially important in systems requiring round-the-clock access or those with time-sensitive functions.

  Look and Feel – Look and feel requirements are quality requirements that consider all static and dynamic aspects of the user interface, including colors, shapes, layout, typefaces, buttons, boxes, and menus. They ensure visual consistency, branding alignment, and intuitive interaction patterns across the system. These requirements may also define responsiveness (e.g., animations, transitions) and accessibility standards (e.g., contrast ratios, font sizes).

  Legal – Legal requirements define a system's conformity with data privacy laws, industry regulations, and technical standards. They ensure compliance with frameworks like GDPR, HIPAA, or ISO certifications, covering: data protection (storage, processing, user consent); auditability (logging, documentation); jurisdictional rules (regional/industry-specific mandates).

  Fault Tolerance – Fault tolerance requirements define the system’s capability to detect, isolate, and recover from failures while maintaining continuous operation. They ensure: automatic fault detection (e.g., checksums, heartbeat signals); redundancy (backup components, failover mechanisms); graceful degradation (preserving critical functions during partial failures).
